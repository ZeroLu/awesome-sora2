2. epic battle

prompt:
Epic medieval war trailer set in a storm-swept valley at dawn.
Hundreds of armored soldiers prepare for battle, banners ripple, horses snort, and the ground trembles under their boots.
Shot on 65mm film with cinematic wide shots and drone sweeps through mist.
The clash begins: swords spark on shields, arrows streak across the sky, mud splatters in slow motion.
Camera tracks a lone knight, silver armor, scarred face, determined eyes, as he charges through chaos.
Cinematic lighting: cold blue-gray tone, natural overcast, enhanced with volumetric fog.
Color grading: desaturated steel hues with crimson accents.
Sound design: thundering drums, echoing war horns, clashing steel, and distant chanting.
Ends with a wide shot of the battlefield in smoke and fire.
Voiceover: “In the age of kings and betrayal… one will rise from ashes.”
Title appears in gold embers: “The Last Kingdom Falls.”
